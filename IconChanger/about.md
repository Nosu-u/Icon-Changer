# Icon Changer

Allows you to change your icons and colors while playing a level by adding a button to the pause menu to do so. For people that definetly can't decide what to use and/or are very impatient.

# Known issues
- If you change any icon while being a robot, the walking animation of it won't work until you jump (looks cool though).
- The glow doesn't update (its color does, but not if it is on or off).
- The normal and ship trails don't update (the wave one does).
